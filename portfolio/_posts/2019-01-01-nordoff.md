In 2019 I did some volunteer work for Nordoff Robbins. I was the main videographer for Nordoff Robbins' "Get Loud" gig at XOYO, London. Later on in the year, I assisted in filming the "Big Busk" event at the O2 Arena. I produced an edited highlights clip following the event which was used on their social media page.
