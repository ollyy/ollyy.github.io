title: "Article 13 Is Concerning"

Yesterday the European Copyright Directive had been approved. The legislation holds numerous components (or “Articles”) for member states to achieve. 

The particular component that has caused the most uproar is called “Article 13”.  And there are questions being asked about the future of online video-sharing platforms as a result. The particular clause will require large video-sharing platforms, like YouTube, to put measures in place that ensure liability is covered for works uploaded by users that infringe copyright holders; and, if liability is not covered, that said works are not made available on the site. 

But what measures do YouTube need to put in place to achieve this? The site already has as system, amongst others, called ContentID that automatically detects infringing material and takes action depending on the right holders’ demands. But even ContentID and YouTube’s other copyright handling systems aren’t entirely accurate and have been open to abuse by those looking to silence or bully content creators. 

_There’s multiple examples of this: [Matt Hoss vs. H3H3](https://youtu.be/9eN0CIyF2ok) and [IHateEverything vs. Derek Savage](https://youtu.be/jzXSQ5f08sA)_

It’s no surprise that Universal, Warner, and James Blunt (who sat in front of the camera reading a script) have all come out supporting the particular article. After all, Content ID pays horribly. But I am worried about what it’ll mean for the future of the site. YouTube _is_ the future of entertainment. Some channels are pulling in millions of views **daily** or **weekly**, far surpassing the viewership of some popular TV channels and shows. 

Musicians have massively benefitted from the site too. Monstercat was born on YouTube in 2011 and now it is arguably the biggest electronic music label in the world; shedding light on incredibly talented bedroom producers. This is just one example out of many. 

There’s lots of hysteria surrounding the news and many people don’t seem to know what will happen when these laws come into effect. But I personally believe musicians should take another look and ask themselves if this new directive will really benefit them in the long run; especially if sites like YouTube will need to seriously hinder their platform as a result.
