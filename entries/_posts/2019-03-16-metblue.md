Metropolis Blue is a joint venture by Metropolis Studios and ACM. The label is run by - and dedicated to - students of the university. 

My role in the label is currently Marketing and Videography. As part of the Videography role I am in charge of the team that are dedicated to producing high quality content. This includes live events, interviews and acoustic sessions. 

On the 11th of March 2019 we released a short showreel of our first live event.
