Metropolis Blue is a joint venture by Metropolis Studios and ACM. The label is run by - and dedicated to - students of the university.

Since March I have been working on multiple small digital marketing campaigns for the brand through Instagram and Facebook; utilising my skillset in graphic design and video editing software. Recently, I have been collaborating with a web developer on the official Metropolis Blue website.
