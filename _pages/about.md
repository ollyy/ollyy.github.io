I'm a videographer, photographer and digital maestro based in London. Since 2018 I have worked with Metropolis Studios, Microsoft and Nordoff Robbins (just to name a few) on a number of productions and edits ‚Äî all of which can be found on the homepage. 

Music has a fond place in my heart and I always try to incorporate it into my work. Therefore, you‚Äôll typically see me working with musicians to produce beautifully shot photos and videos.

People often ask about my star sign, but I think playlists are a better way to understand a person. If you want to check out the tunes I listen to on a regular basis, click [here](https://open.spotify.com/user/11173788945?si=bbac994070b5489c). You‚Äôll find everything from _Acid House_ to _Disco_, _Funk_, and _Madchester_. 

If you want to get in touch, feel free to reach out to me via [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ollyyj/) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olly/). I would include my email address, but then I‚Äôd get spammed with offers for web design _(I mean, com'on...did they not see this website?? it‚Äôs really cool I think)_

In our house, we are all equal. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
