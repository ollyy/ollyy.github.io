Hi there. My name is Olly and I am a university student studying for a degree in Music Business.

I'm new to the music industry but I have been producing music since the age of 13. Alongside Music Business I dabble in DJing, videography and website design. 

(*In a nutshell I try new hobbies that interest me and see what sticks*)

On this site you will find blog posts and my portfolio (*which is coming soon*). I write about anything that comes to my mind. 

I designed the site myself with help from the Jekyll `minima` template - which I have sightly adapted. You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).
