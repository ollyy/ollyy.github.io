After a successful launch party for the student-run Metropolis Blue record label I created this short montage to show off some of the best moments from the night.

A big thank you to the team, Joe Dallison and [Kailan Blanks](https://www.facebook.com/kB.mediaservices/) for helping film the night.

*Side note: Can you spot the footage that was shot on an iPhone? Follow up post coming soon.*
